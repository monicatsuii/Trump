                Twitter was a major part of Trump’s presidency and his
                administration; with a massive social media following, he could
                shape the nation’s politics and influence media heavily. By
                posting multiple times daily, Trump’s tweets are constantly
                trending which reinforce his strong online influence, creating
                an advantage for his presidential campaigns (Kroon, 2018).

                This study utilises an archive of all tweets from President
                Trump’s terms in the office to analyse trends and relationships
                in comparison with the US stock market.

                President Trump heavily relied on Twitter as his main source of
                communication to the public. It can be seen in the graph, the
                volume that Trump has posted on the platform in comparison to
                events that are occuring, especially during the re-election
                period. Studies have shown that he has used Twitter to spread
                consipracy theories, fake information and extremist content
                ("How Trump Reshaped the Presidency in Over 11,000 Tweets",
                2019). This is seen in Trump’s favourite phrase, “fake news”
                roughly 1,000 times during his presidency.

                Trump has mentioned the words “stock” 152 times throughout his
                history of tweets during his presidency, with an average
                sentiment score of 0.2. Being that his tweets lean towards a
                positive sentiment, Trump claims credit for rises in the stock
                market often when it would increase. In this graph, we analyse
                the relationship between Trump’s tweets related to “stocks” and
                the performance of the S&P 500 Index, which is a “market
                capitalization-weighted index of the 500 largest publicly-traded
                companies in the US” (Kenton, 2021).
